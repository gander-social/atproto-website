# Identity

The atproto identity system has a number of requirements:

* **ID provision.** Users should be able to create global IDs which are stable across services. These IDs should never change, to ensure that links to their content are stable.
* **Public key distribution.** Distributed systems rely on cryptography to prove the authenticity of data. The identity system must publish their public keys with strong security.
* **Key rotation.** Users must be able to rotate their key material without disrupting their identity.
* **Service discovery.** Applications must be able to discover the services in use by a given user.
* **Usability.** Users should have human-readable and memorable names.
* **Portability.** Identities should be portable across services. Changing a provider should not cause a user to lose their identity, social graph, or content.

Using the atproto identity system gives applications the tools for end-to-end encryption, signed user data, service sign-in, and general interoperation.

## Identifiers

We use two interrelated forms of identifiers: _handles_ and _DIDs_. Handles are DNS names while DIDs are a [W3C standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) with multiple implementations which provide secure & stable IDs. AT Protocol supports the DID PLC and DID Web variants.

The following are all valid user identifiers:

```
alice.host.com
at://alice.host.com
did:plc:bv6ggog3tya2z3vxsub7hnal
```

The relationship between them can be visualized as:

```
┌──────────────────┐                 ┌───────────────┐
│ DNS name         ├──resolves to──→ │ DID           │

└──────────────────┘                 └─────┬─────────┘
       ↑                                   │
       │                               resolves to
       │                                   │
       │                                   ↓
       │                            ┌───────────────┐
       └───────────references───────┤ DID Document  │
                                    │ {"id":"..."}  │
                                    └───────────────┘
```

The DNS handle is a user-facing identifier — it should be displayed in user interfaces and promoted as a way to find users. Applications resolve handles to DIDs and then use the DID as the canonical identifier for accounts. Any DID can be rapidly resolved to a DID document which includes public keys and user services.

## DID Methods

The [DID standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) describes a framework for different "methods" of publishing and resolving DIDs to the [DID Document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#core-properties), instead of specifying a single mechanism. A variety of existing methods [have been registered](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods), with different features and properties. We established the following criteria for use with atproto:

- **Strong consistency.** For a given DID, a resolution query should produce only one valid document at any time. (In some networks, this may be subject to probabilistic transaction finality.)
- **High availability**. Resolution queries must succeed reliably.
- **Online API**. Clients must be able to publish new DID documents through a standard API.
- **Secure**. The network must protect against attacks from its operators, a Man-in-the-Middle, and other users.
- **Low cost**. Creating and updating DID documents must be affordable to services and users.
- **Key rotation**. Users must be able to rotate keypairs without losing their identity.
- **Decentralized governance**. The network should not be governed by a single stakeholder; it must be an open network or a consortium of providers.

When we started the project, none of the existing DID methods met all of these criteria. Therefore, we chose to support both the existing [did-web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) method (which is simple), and a novel method we created called [DID PLC](https://github.com/gander-social/did-method-plc).

## Handle Resolution

Handles in atproto are domain names which resolve to a DID, which in turn resolves to a DID Document containing the user's signing key and hosting service.

Handle resolution uses either a DNS TXT record, or an HTTPS well-known endpoint. Details can be found in the [Handle specification](/specs/handle).


### Example: Hosting service

Consider a scenario where a hosting service is using PLC and is providing the handle for the user as a subdomain:

- The handle: `alice.pds.com`
- The DID: `did:plc:12345`
- The hosting service: `https://pds.com`

At first, all we know is `alice.pds.com`, so we look up the DNS TXT record `_atproto.alice.pds.com`. This tells us the DID: `did:plc:12345`.

Next we query the PLC directory for the DID, so that we can learn the hosting service's endpoint and the user's key material.

```typescript
await didPlc.resolve('did:plc:12345') /* => {
  id: 'did:plc:12345',
  alsoKnownAs: `https://alice.pds.com`,
  verificationMethod: [...],
  service: [{serviceEndpoint: 'https://pds.com', ...}]
}*/
```

We can now communicate with `https://pds.com` to access Alice's data.

### Example: Self-hosted

Let's consider a self-hosting scenario. If it's using `did:plc`, it would look something like:

- The handle: `alice.com`
- The DID: `did:plc:12345`
- The hosting service: `https://alice.com`

However, **if the self-hoster is confident they will retain ownership of the domain name**, they can use `did:web` instead of `did:plc`:

- The handle: `alice.com`
- The DID: `did:web:alice.com`
- The hosting service: `https://alice.com`

We can resolve the handle the same way, resolving `_atproto.alice.com`, which returns the DID: `did:web:alice.com`

Which we then resolve:

```typescript
await didWeb.resolve('did:web:alice.com') /* => {
  id: 'did:web:alice.com',
  alsoKnownAs: `https://alice.com`,
  verificationMethod: [...],
  service: [{serviceEndpoint: 'https://alice.com', ...}]
}*/
```
